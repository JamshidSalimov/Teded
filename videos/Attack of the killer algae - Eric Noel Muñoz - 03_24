What kind of challenges come up when trying to tell people they can no longer enjoy boating, fishing or other recreational activities in an area that has been infested with Caulerpa taxifolia?", "question_type": "open-ended"}, {"quiz_description": "Natural plants and animals have natural controls on their geographic location and overall distribution. This is nature in balance, but invasive species can disrupt that balance. When genetically modified organisms like the aquarium strain of Caulerpa taxifolia get established and spread without any way to control it, we can see the damaging effects of genetically modified species.
