{"quizzes": [{"quiz_description": "What are aerosol particles in the atmosphere and can you suggest some of the ways they originate? Aerosol particles provide the seeds for cloud droplets. Clouds cool Earth's surface by reflecting incoming sunlight and also warm it by emitting infrared radiation. However, one of these effects is larger and so, globally averaged, do clouds lead to a net warming or cooling? Give one example from your personal experience of clouds a) cooling and b) warming Earth's surface.", "question_type": "open-ended"}, {"quiz_description": "Under equilibrium conditions, the incoming solar radiation on Earth is exactly balanced by the radiation emitted back out to space, and so Earth's average temperature stays constant. If you waved a magic wand and suddenly doubled the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, less radiation would be emitted back out to space. So there would be an excess of incoming radiation and the Earth would start to warm up. Would it continue to warm up forever? Or do you think it would warm up for some years and eventually stop and, if so, why would the warming stop?", "question_type": "open-ended"}, {"quiz_description": "A certain climate model calculates a climate sensitivity of 0.8 Celsius per Watt/m2.
