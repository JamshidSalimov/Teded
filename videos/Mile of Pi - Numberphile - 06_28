Now imagine the team want to roll out the first million digits of Pi all the way to the \"nearby\" star Alpha Centauri, at a distance of 4.37 light-years. But this time they can USE ONLY ONE MILLION DIGITS (not add more digits), so clearly the point size will need to be scaled up. Keeping all things in proportion, what will the new point size be? How wide is each digit on this piece of paper which stretches through space?", "question_type": "open-ended"}, {"quiz_description": "What is the probability that your birthday DD/MM/YY is found within the first million digits of Pi?

Imagine you know NOTHING about Pi, but have to GUESS each digit in order. Each time you get a digit wrong, you must start again from the first digit (and your memory of the previous attempt is erased). On average, how many \"attempts\" will it take until you correctly recite Pi to 67,890 digits, getting all of them right? Imagine throughout this process, you can speak at one digit per second.
