The electric force, for instance, is only felt by charged particles (like electrons or protons), and is not felt by neutral particles (like neutrons or neutrinos).

But the expansion is speeding up, which is more surprising, because everything ought to be pulled back together. How can accelerated expansion be reconciled with Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity?
